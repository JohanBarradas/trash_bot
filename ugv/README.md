This is a ROS package used for an autonomous UGV for research at the University of Texas at Arlington.
This package only implements the motor control, /cmd_vel and /odom. For urdf, taranis controller, and lidar, install UDV package as well.

This package works on differential drive robots using a Roboteq motor controller. (Tested on HDC2460 and MDC2460)
This package has been tested successfully with ROS Kinetic and Melodic

TODO: At a later date, I will add the configuration file for my motor driver (MDC2460)

ROS Parameters
* /motor_controller_usb, which Linux device the Roboteq controller is registered as. Default: /dev/ttyACM0
* /ugv_vel_in_scalar, Default: (PI/3.0)
* /ugv_vel_out_scalar, Default: (5.30516666)
* /ugv_odom_scalar, Default: (PI/25200.0)
        
Please ensure your controller has the following settings:
* Left wheel connected to motor 1
* Right wheel connected to motor 2
* Encoders connected, tested, and set to tuned PID coefficients in closed-loop speed control
* Encoder ticks per revolution properly calculated through gear ratio and encoder specs
* Max velocity for each wheel set to 60 RPM
* Some parameters may need to be tuned and changed based on your build. Trial and error.

Edit ugv.launch to have the correct wheel_separation and wheel_radius for your robot

After wheels respond to correct direction, speed can be adjusted through proper calculation (or trial and error) of /ugv_vel_in_scalar or /ugv_vel_out_scalar

After wheels respond to correct speed, odom can be adjusted through proper calculation (or trial and error, listed below) of /ugv_odom_scalar

My current method for tuning odom (requires a lidar and transform tree):
* Visualize in Rviz with /odom as global frame.
* View lidar and transform tree
* Rotate robot clockwise.
* * If lidar scan rotates to the right: Decrease the /ugv_odom_scalar parameter
* * If lidar scan rotates to the left:  Increase the /ugv_odom_scalar parameter
* When robot is able to rotate N-rotations without rotation of the laser scan, odom is properly tuned (my N=100)
